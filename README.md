# S3 bucket based website - Personal Porforlio

## Overview
The objective of this project is to set up the deployment of a static website on AWS, utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) through Terraform. Also aiming to establish a seamless CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Changes will be staged for code testing and review, with the final deployment to live production requiring a 'Pull Request' to the main branch after changes have been validated on a working branch. Additionally, the project adheres to cloud security best practices, implementing the principle of least privilege by assigning only the necessary policies to the IAM Role for the workflow, ensuring secure provisioning of resources.
